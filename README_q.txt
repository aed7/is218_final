a.  Unit testing is as straight forward as the name implies it a test design to test the individual parts or functions of code. In doing so we can test part of the code and this makes it easier to write code that is easy to test. It is important because it helps us identify failures in the algorithms and it also helps improve the overall quality of the code developed.
b.	Functional testing is a variation of black-box testing meaning that is a method that tests the functionality of an application as opposed to its internal structure. It requires no knowledge of the inner design of the code. It is important because we are making sure that the client’s requirements are implemented in the final product as specified in the contract.
c.	Automated unit testing lets you find errors early in the development cycle of the project. It also helps save times since the developers don’t have to write new unit testing for each iteration of code. As stated before it reduces the need for manual testing. Automated unit testing is more widely used in the enterprise environment because even though it reduces the need for individual unit testing (code writing) it takes a lot of time and resources to create and adequate automated test.
d.	Automated unit testing is mostly implemented in frameworks testing (NUnit frameworks). You can find more information about unit testing here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5404/The-benefits-of-automated-unit-testing.
e.	Test driven development is a method of software development in which unit is repeatedly done on source code. This process is repeated several times as necessary until each unit is functioning according to the desire specifications. It can also be described as an automated test and it is important because it helps ensure code quality and it eliminates the need to invoke a debugger.
